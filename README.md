STM8 (SPŠE) Toolchain
==============================

[🇨🇿 Česká verze](README.cs.md) | **🇬🇧 English**

* This is a starter source code tree and `Makefile` for teaching Microprocessor
  Technology with [STM8S](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm8s-series.html).
* The tree is designed for the [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) compiler (or
  [SDCC-gas](https://github.com/XaviDCR92/sdcc-gas)).
* The Standard Peripheral Library [SPL](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm8-embedded-software/stsw-stm8069.html)
  *should* (for licensing reasons) be downloaded separately from the manufacturer's website and use the
  [patch](https://github.com/gicking/STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch). But I think if you run
  `make spl` it won't be a sin.

Three Makefiles
------------------------------------

There are three `Makefile` variants available in the `.make` directory. This is because the
`SDCC` compiler cannot remove dead code. There are three solutions. The first one is
the most optimal, the other two solutions are kept just in case. **When you run `make`
for the first time, the toolchain will switch to the most optimal solution called `sdcc`.**

To select a Makefile, run:

```zsh
make
# or
make sdcc
# or
make sdcc-gas
# or
make sdccrm
```


You can switch between `Makefile` variants later:

    make switch-sdcc
    make switch-sdcc-gas
    make switch-sdccrm

Switching only means creating a symlink to the root directory of the project. On systems
that don't support symlinks (like Windows), the file is copied instead, so this operation
may be lossy. On normal systems (pretty much all except Windows), this operation is lossless.

Usage
--------------

First, you need to select a Makefile. If you haven't done so yet, run:

    make

Then you need to configure the microprocessor and its frequency in the `Makefile`;
optionally the path to SDCC installation, or
[STVP](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stvp-stm8.html).

```make
#DEVICE_FLASH=stm8s103f3
DEVICE_FLASH=stm8s208rb

### STlink version for flash2 target (stm8flash program)
#STLINK=stlinkv2
#STLINK=stlink
STLINK=stlinkv21

F_CPU=16000000

ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)
	CC_ROOT = "/c/Program Files/SDCC"
	STVP_ROOT = "/c/Program Files (x86)/STMicroelectronics/st_toolset/stvp"
else
	CC_ROOT = /usr
endif
```

... and then just tinker, program and run `make`.

|:---------- |:--------------------------- |
| `make spl` | downloads and prepares libraries |
| `make` | compiles the project (alias for `make ihx`) |
| `make ihx` | compiles to Intel HEX format |
| `make elf` | compiles to ELF format (with debug info) |
| `make all` | compiles both (ihx and elf) |
| `make flash` | uploads the program to the chip. On Linux it uses [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/). On Windows it uses [STVP](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stvp-stm8.html) command line version.|
| `make flash2` | alternative method (uses [stm8flash](https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash)). |
| `make reflash` | cleans everything and uploads again |
| `make clean` | deletes everything that was compiled |
| `make cleanall` | deletes everything including SPL libraries |
| `make rebuild` | cleans everything and recompiles |
| `make openocd` | runs `openocd` for debugging |
| `make gdb` | runs STM8-gdb |
| `make gdbgui` | runs [gdbgui](https://www.gdbgui.com) (if installed) |
| `make tree` | displays the project tree |
| `make spl-renew` | re-downloads SPL libraries |
| `make switch-sdcc` | switches to pure SDCC Makefile |
| `make switch-sdcc-gas` | switches to SDCC-gas Makefile |
| `make switch-sdccrm` | switches to SDCCRM Makefile |
